Multi-Agent Architecture with Semantic Kernel

Orchestrator Agent

A main orchestrator agent coordinates all operations
Analyzes incoming queries to understand user intent
Routes requests to the appropriate specialized agent based on intent classification
Uses Semantic Kernel's planner or intent recognition capabilities to determine which agent should handle each task
Aggregates responses from multiple agents when needed

Intent Classification & Agent Selection

Semantic Kernel analyzes the query semantics to identify intent
The orchestrator maps intents to specific agents (e.g., data retrieval agent, processing agent, analytics agent)
Each specialized agent is registered with the orchestrator and handles specific domains or tasks

Data Layer

Azure Cosmos DB serves as the primary data store
Agents perform database operations (CRUD) through Cosmos DB SDK or Semantic Kernel connectors
Store conversation history, agent state, and application data

Caching Strategy

Implement caching at the Semantic Kernel level to reduce redundant LLM calls
Cache frequent queries, agent responses, and embedding results
Use memory connectors (volatile or persistent) for session-based caching
Consider Azure Cache for Redis for distributed caching across agents
